				The Historic Centre of Kraków, the former capital of Poland, is situated
        at the foot of the Royal Wawel Castle. The 13th-century merchants' town
        has Europe's largest market square and numerous historical houses,
        palaces and churches with their magnificent interiors. Further evidence
        of the town's fascinating history is provided by the remnants of the
        14th-century fortifications and the medieval site of Kazimierz with its
        ancient synagogues in the southern part of town, Jagellonian University
        and the Gothic cathedral where the kings of Poland were buried.

        The first major rebuilt of the Royal Castle took place under the rule
        of Casimir III the Great, who reigned from 1333 to 1370. The reign of
        Casimir III the Great is often defined as the golden era of Polish
        development, what is undoubtedly reflected in Castle’s architecture.
        During the rebuilt, the Castle was adapted to be not only the king’s
        residence but also to house expanding state apparatus.

				The deposit of rock salt in Wieliczka has been mined since the 13th
        century. This major industrial undertaking has royal status and is the
        oldest of its type in Europe. The Wieliczka Salt Mines illustrate the
        historic stages of the development of mining techniques in Europe from
        the 13th to the 20th centuries: the mines have hundreds of kilometers
        of galleries with works of art, underground chapels and statues sculpted
        in the salt, making a fascinating pilgrimage into the past.
